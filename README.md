# Requirement Analysis in Software Development  

This repository contains details about requirement analysis as it concerns software development. It explains what it involves, its importance in SDLC, types of requirements, use case diagrams, acceptance criteria etc.

## What is requirement analysis

Requirement analysis is a stage in the software development lifecycle when the needs as well as the expectations of a new software are determined.  
This stage invloves constant communication with stakeholders and end-users of the product to define expectations, resolve conflicts as well as documentation of all the key requirements.  
Requirement analysis is a very critical step in software development and plays a very important role in how the product looks in the end.  

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important

- It is essential in making it clear to the stakeholders what t expect from the software and as  such reduces ambiguity in the process.  
- Helps to clearly defines the scope of the project hence preventing scope creep.  
- Provides a solid basis for designing and developing a system.  
- It also ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements making it very crucial to ensuring customer satisfaction.  
- It facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources and time making it a very essential item in ensuring proper allocation of resources.  

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis  

All activities involved in requirement analysis have been placed into five groups. THese groups include:  

### Requirement Gathering  

This is when the various requiremtents of the software are collected. The collection process looks like:  

- Conducting interviews with stake holders to be able to find out about their needs and expectations.  
- Distributing surveys to collect requiremtns from a larger audience.  
- Obseerving end users in their wrking environment to understand their needs.  
- Reviewing existing documentation and systems to understand current functionalities and requirements.

### Requirement elicitation

This is the practice of researching and discovering the requirements of a system from stakeholders.  
Achieving this involves:  

- Conductuing brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and gather requirements.  
- Holding focus group discussions with select stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.  
- Creating prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system and refine their requirements.  

### Requirement Documentation

After requiremnts have been collceted from all stakeholders, it is important that they are documented.  
Some of the steps performed in this stage are:  

- Creation of  a detailed document listing all functional and non-functional requirements.  
- Writing of user stories to describe functionalities from the user's perspective.  
- Creation of use case diagrams to show interactions between users and the system.  

### Requirement Analysis and Modeling

This stage invloves the following steps:  

- Prioritization of requirements based on their importance and impact on the project.  
- Assessment of the feasibility of requirements in terms of technical, financial and time constraints.  
- Creation of models to visualize and analyze requirements.  

### Requirement validation

The steps involved in this stage include:  

- Reviewing of the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.  
- Definition of clear acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet expected standards.  
- Establishment of traceability matrices to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.  

## Types of Requirements

There are two types of requirements in requirements analysis and they include:  

### Functional requirements

These are requirements that describe what the system should do, its features and functions.  
They focus more on the user requiremnts.  
They are mandatory and are often defined by the user.  
A few examples of such requirements include user authentication, user registration, propersy search and the booking system.  

### Non-functional requirements

These requiremnts define how the system should perform or the general properties of a software system. They are often reffered to as quality attributes.  
These requiremnts focus on user expectation and are often defined by developers or other experts.  
They are not mandatory but are desirable.  
Examples include performance, security, scalability, reliability and usability.  

## Use Case Diagrams

Thse serve as a visual representation that illustrate the interactions between users and a system.  
A use case diagram provides a high level view of the system's functionality by illustrating the various ways a user can interact with it.  

### Benefits of use case diagrams

- They help visualize how different users interact with the system.
- Help provide a clear and simple way to convey system functionality.
- Help to outline user interactions and plan features ensuring that the design aligns with user needs.
- Help define a boundary of what is included in the system and what is not.
